How to use it

To use the repository, simply clone it to your local machine and open it in a code editor. You can then start customizing the code to match your own needs and preferences.

To get started, you should first update the config.yml file with your own personal information, such as your name, contact information, and social media links. You should also create a projects directory and add a directory for each project that you want to showcase on your website.

Once you have added your projects, you can start customizing the design of your website using the Sass file. You can also add additional pages, such as a blog or contact page.

When you are finished customizing the website, you can deploy it to a web server using the Gulp file. This will compile the Sass, minify the CSS and JavaScript, and create a production-ready version of your website.
